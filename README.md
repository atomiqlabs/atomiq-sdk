### Preparations

Set Solana & Starknet RPC URL to use

```typescript
const solanaRpc = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com";
const starknetRpc = "https://starknet-mainnet.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8";
const citreaRpc = "https://rpc.testnet.citrea.xyz";
```

Create swapper factory, here we can pick and choose which chains we want to have supported in the SDK, ensure the "as const" keyword is used such that the typescript compiler can properly infer the types.

```typescript
import {SolanaInitializer, SolanaInitializerType} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-solana";
import {StarknetInitializer, StarknetInitializerType} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-starknet";
import {CitreaInitializer, CitreaInitializerType} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-evm";
import {SwapperFactory} from "@atomiqlabs/sdk";

const Factory = new SwapperFactory<[SolanaInitializerType, StarknetInitializerType, CitreaInitializerType]>([SolanaInitializer, StarknetInitializer, CitreaInitializer] as const);
const Tokens = Factory.Tokens; //Get the supported tokens for all the specified chains.
```

#### Browser

This uses browser's Indexed DB by default

```typescript
import {BitcoinNetwork} from "@atomiqlabs/sdk";

const swapper = Factory.newSwapper({
    chains: {
        SOLANA: {
            rpcUrl: solanaRpc //You can also pass Connection object here
        },
        STARKNET: {
            rpcUrl: starknetRpc //You can also pass Provider object here           
        },
        CITREA: {
            rpcUrl: citreaRpc, //You can also pass JsonApiProvider object here
        }
    },
    bitcoinNetwork: BitcoinNetwork.TESTNET //or BitcoinNetwork.MAINNET, BitcoinNetwork.TESTNET4 - this also sets the network to use for Solana (solana devnet for bitcoin testnet) & Starknet (sepolia for bitcoin testnet)
});
```

if you want to use custom pricing api, mempool.space RPC url, or tune HTTP request timeouts check out [additional options](#additional-swapper-options)

#### NodeJS

For NodeJS we need to use sqlite storage, for that we first need to install the sqlite storage adaptor

```
npm install @atomiqlabs/storage-sqlite@next
```

Then use pass it in the newSwapper function

```typescript
import {SqliteStorageManager, SqliteUnifiedStorage} from "@atomiqlabs/storage-sqlite";
import {BitcoinNetwork} from "@atomiqlabs/sdk";

const swapper = Factory.newSwapper({
    chains: {
        SOLANA: {
            rpcUrl: solanaRpc //You can also pass Connection object here
        },
        STARKNET: {
            rpcUrl: starknetRpc //You can also pass Provider object here
        },
        CITREA: {
            rpcUrl: citreaRpc, //You can also pass JsonApiProvider object here
        }
    },
    bitcoinNetwork: BitcoinNetwork.TESTNET, //or BitcoinNetwork.MAINNET - this also sets the network to use for Solana (solana devnet for bitcoin testnet) & Starknet (sepolia for bitcoin testnet)
    //The following lines are important for running on backend node.js,
    // because the SDK by default uses browser's Indexed DB
    swapStorage: chainId => new SqliteUnifiedStorage("CHAIN_"+chainId+".sqlite3"),
    chainStorageCtor: name => new SqliteStorageManager("STORE_"+name+".sqlite3"),
});
```

if you want to use custom pricing api, mempool.space RPC url, or tune HTTP request timeouts check out [additional options](#additional-swapper-options)

### Signer

```typescript
import {SolanaSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-solana";
//Browser - react, using solana wallet adapter
const anchorWallet = useAnchorWallet();
const wallet = new SolanaSigner(anchorWallet);
```

```typescript
import {WalletAccount} from "starknet";
import {StarknetSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-starknet";
//Browser, using get-starknet
const swo = await connect();
const wallet = new StarknetBrowserSigner(new WalletAccount(starknetRpc, swo.wallet));
```

or

```typescript
import {Keypair} from "@solana/web3.js";
import {SolanaKeypairWallet, SolanaSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-solana";
//Creating Solana signer from private key
const solanaSigner = new SolanaSigner(new SolanaKeypairWallet(Keypair.fromSecretKey(solanaKey)), Keypair.fromSecretKey(solanaKey));
```

```typescript
import {StarknetSigner, StarknetKeypairWallet} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-starknet";
//Creating Starknet signer from private key
const starknetSigner = new StarknetSigner(new StarknetKeypairWallet(starknetRpc, starknetKey));
```

```typescript
import {BaseWallet, SigningKey} from "ethers";
import {EVMSigner} from "@atomiqlabs/chain-evm";
//Creating EVM signer from private key
const wallet = new BaseWallet(new SigningKey(evmKey));
const evmWallet = new EVMSigner(wallet, wallet.address);
```

### Initialization

Initialize the swapper, this should be done once when your app starts. Checks existing in-progress swaps and does initial LP discovery

```typescript
await swapper.init();
```

Now we have the multichain swapper initialized

### Extract chain-specific swapper with signer

To make it easier to do swaps between bitcoin and a specific chain we can extract a chain-specific swapper, and also set a signer. e.g.:

```typescript
const solanaSwapper = swapper.withChain<"SOLANA">("SOLANA");
```

### Bitcoin on-chain swaps

#### Swap Smart chain -> Bitcoin on-chain

Getting swap quote

```typescript
//Create the swap: swapping SOL to Bitcoin on-chain, receiving _amount of satoshis (smallest unit of bitcoin) to _address
const swap = await swapper.swap(
    Tokens.SOLANA.SOL, //From specified source token
    Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, //Swap to BTC
    "0.0001", //Amount can be either passed in base units as bigint or in decimal format as string
    SwapAmountType.EXACT_OUT, //EXACT_OUT, so we specify the output amount
    solanaSigner.getAddress(), //Source address and smart chain signer
    "bc1qtw67hj77rt8zrkkg3jgngutu0yfgt9czjwusxt" //BTC address of the recipient
);

//Get the amount required to pay and fee
const input: string = swap.getInputWithoutFee().toString(); //Input amount excluding fees
const fee: string = swap.getFee().amountInSrcToken.toString(); //Fees paid on the output
const inputWithFees: string = swap.getInput().toString(); //Total amount paid including fees

const output: string = swap.getOutput().toString(); //Total output amount

//Get swap expiration time
const expiry: number = swap.getQuoteExpiry(); //Expiration time of the swap quote in UNIX milliseconds, swap needs to be initiated before this time

//Get pricing info
const swapPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().swapPrice; //Price of the current swap (excluding fees)
const marketPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().marketPrice; //Current market price
const difference = swap.getPriceInfo().difference; //Difference between the swap price & current market price
```

Executing the swap (simple)

```typescript
const swapSuccessful = await swap.execute(
    solanaSigner,
    { //Callbacks
        onSourceTransactionSent: (txId: string) => {
            //Transaction on the source chain was sent
        },
        onSourceTransactionConfirmed: (txId: string) => {
            //Transaction on the source chain was confirmed
        },
        onSwapSettled: (destinationTxId: string) => {
            //Bitcoin transaction on the destination chain was sent and swap settled
        }
    }
);

//Refund in case of failure
if(!swapSuccessful) {
    //Swap failed, money can be refunded
    await swap.refund(solanaSigner);
} else {
    //Swap successful!
}
```

<details>
<summary>Manual swap execution (advanced)</summary>

- __1.__ Initiate the swap on the smart-chain side

  - __a.__ Commit with a signer
  ```typescript
  await swap.commit(solanaSigner);
  ```

  - __b.__ Or get the transactions & [sign and send transaction manually](#manually-signing-smart-chain-transactions)
  ```typescript
  const txsCommit = await swap.txsCommit();
  //Sign and send these...
  ...
  //Important to wait till SDK processes the swap initialization
  await swap.waitTillCommited();
  ```

- __2.__ Wait for the swap to execute and for the payment to be sent
  ```typescript
  const swapSuccessful = await swap.waitForPayment();
  ```

- __3.__ In case the swap fails we can refund our funds on the source chain

  - __a.__ Refund with a signer
  ```typescript
  if(!swapSuccessful) {
      await swap.refund(solanaSigner);
      return;
  }
  ```

  - __b.__ Or get the transactions & [sign and send transaction manually](#manually-signing-smart-chain-transactions)
  ```typescript
  if(!swapSuccessful) {
      const txsRefund = await swap.txsRefund();
      //Sign and send these...
      ...
  }
  ```

#### Swap Bitcoin on-chain -> Solana

NOTE: Solana uses an old swap protocol for Bitcoin on-chain -> Solana swaps, the flow here is different from the one for Starknet and other chains.

Getting swap quote

```typescript
//Create the swap: swapping _amount of satoshis of Bitcoin on-chain to SOL
const swap = await swapper.swap(
    Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, //Swap from BTC
    Tokens.SOLANA.SOL, //Into specified destination token
    "0.0001", //Amount can be either passed in base units as bigint or in decimal format as string
    SwapAmountType.EXACT_IN, //EXACT_IN, so we specify the input amount
    undefined, //Source address for the swap, not used for swaps from BTC
    solanaSigner.getAddress() //Destination address
);

//Get the amount required to pay and fee
const input: string = swap.getInputWithoutFee().toString(); //Input amount excluding fees
const fee: string = swap.getFee().amountInSrcToken.toString(); //Fees paid on the output
const inputWithFees: string = swap.getInput().toString(); //Total amount paid including fees

const output: string = swap.getOutput().toString(); //Total output amount

//Get swap expiration time
const expiry: number = swap.getQuoteExpiry(); //Expiration time of the swap quote in UNIX milliseconds, swap needs to be initiated before this time

//Get security deposit amount (Human readable amount of SOL that needs to be put down to rent the liquidity from swap intermediary), you will get this deposit back if the swap succeeds
const securityDeposit: string = swap.getSecurityDeposit().toString();
//Get claimer bounty (Human readable amount of SOL reserved as a reward for watchtowers to claim the swap on your behalf)
const claimerBounty: string = swap.getClaimerBounty().toString();

//Get pricing info
const swapPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().swapPrice; //Price of the current swap (excluding fees)
const marketPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().marketPrice; //Current market price
const difference = swap.getPriceInfo().difference; //Difference between the swap price & current market price
```

Executing the swap (simple)

```typescript
const automaticSettlementSuccess = await swap.execute(
    solanaSigner,
    { //Bitcoin wallet, you can also pass null/undefined and send the bitcoin transaction from an external wallet
        address: "bc1pscnrk588hdj79mwccucu06007mj5np2jurwfwp5mvhkjldzyphzqyk62m5",

        signPsbt: (psbt: {psbt, psbtHex: string, psbtBase64: string}, signInputs: number[]) => {
            //Sign the PSBT with the bitcoin wallet
            ...
            //Return the signed PSBT in the hex or base64 format!
            return "<signed PSBT>";
        }
    },
    { //Callbacks
        onDestinationCommitSent: (swapAddressOpeningTxId: string) => {
            //Swap address opening transaction sent on the destination chain
        },
        onSourceTransactionSent: (txId: string) => {
            //Bitcoin transaction sent on the source
        },
        onSourceTransactionConfirmationStatus: (txId: string, confirmations: number, targetConfirmations: number, txEtaMs: number) => {
            //Bitcoin transaction confirmation status updates
        },
        onSourceTransactionConfirmed: (txId: string) => {
            //Bitcoin transaction confirmed
        },
        onSwapSettled: (destinationTxId: string) => {
            //Swap settled on the destination
        }
    }
);

//In case the automatic swap settlement fails, we can settle it manually using the wallet of the destination chain
if(!automaticSettlementSuccess) {
    await swap.claim(solanaSigner);
}

    {
        gasAmount: 1_000_000_000_000_000_000n //We can also request a gas drop on the destination chain (here requesting 1 STRK)
    }
);

//Get the amount required to pay and fee
const input: string = swap.getInputWithoutFee().toString(); //Input amount excluding fees
const fee: string = swap.getFee().amountInSrcToken.toString(); //Fees paid on the output

### Bitcoin lightning network swaps

#### Swap Smart chain -> Bitcoin lightning network

Getting swap quote

```typescript
//Create the swap: swapping SOL to Bitcoin lightning
const swap = await swapper.swap(
    Tokens.SOLANA.SOL, //From specified source token
    Tokens.BITCOIN.BTCLN, //Swap to BTC-LN
    undefined, //Amount is specified in the lightning network invoice!
    SwapAmountType.EXACT_OUT, //Make sure we use EXACT_OUT for swaps to BTC-LN, if you want to use EXACT_IN and set an amount, use LNURL-pay!
    solanaSigner.getAddress(), //Source address and smart chain signer
    //Destination lightning network invoice, amount needs to be part of the invoice!
    "lnbc10u1pj2q0g9pp5ejs6m677m39cznpzum7muruvh50ys93ln82p4j9ks2luqm56xxlshp52r2anlhddfa9ex9vpw9gstxujff8a0p8s3pzvua930js0kwfea6scqzzsxqyz5vqsp5073zskc5qfgp7lre0t6s8uexxxey80ax564hsjklfwfjq2ew0ewq9qyyssqvzmgs6f8mvuwgfa9uqxhtza07qem4yfhn9wwlpskccmuwplsqmh8pdy6c42kqdu8p73kky9lsnl40qha5396d8lpgn90y27ltfc5rfqqq59cya"
);

//Get the amount required to pay and fee
const input: string = swap.getInputWithoutFee().toString(); //Input amount excluding fees
const fee: string = swap.getFee().amountInSrcToken.toString(); //Fees paid on the output
const inputWithFees: string = swap.getInput().toString(); //Total amount paid including fees

const output: string = swap.getOutput().toString(); //Total output amount

//Get swap expiration time
const expiry: number = swap.getQuoteExpiry(); //Expiration time of the swap quote in UNIX milliseconds, swap needs to be initiated before this time

//Get pricing info
const swapPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().swapPrice; //Price of the current swap (excluding fees)
const marketPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().marketPrice; //Current market price
const difference = swap.getPriceInfo().difference; //Difference between the swap price & current market price
```

Executing the swap (simple)

```typescript
const swapSuccessful = await swap.execute(
    solanaSigner,
    { //Callbacks
        onSourceTransactionSent: (txId: string) => {
            //Transaction on the source chain was sent

            //Lightning payment on the destination chain was sent and swap settled
        }
    }

//Refund in case of failure
if(!swapSuccessful) {
    //Swap failed, money can be refunded
    await swap.refund(solanaSigner);
} else {
    //Swap successful!

#### Swap Bitcoin lightning network -> Solana

NOTE: Solana uses an old swap protocol for Bitcoin lightning network -> Solana swaps, the flow here is different from the one for Starknet and other chains.

Getting swap quote

```typescript
const swap = await swapper.swap(
    Tokens.BITCOIN.BTCLN, //Swap from BTC-LN
    Tokens.SOLANA.SOL, //Into specified destination token
    10000n, //Amount can be either passed in base units as bigint or in decimal format as string
    SwapAmountType.EXACT_IN, //SwapAmountType.EXACT_IN, so we specify the input amount
    undefined, //Source address for the swap, not used for swaps from BTC-LN
    signer.getAddress() //Destination address
);

//Get the bitcoin lightning network invoice (the invoice contains pre-entered amount)
const receivingLightningInvoice: string = swap.getAddress();
//Get the URI hyperlink (contains the lightning network invoice) which can be displayed also as QR code
const qrCodeData: string = swap.getHyperlink();

//Get the amount required to pay and fee
const input: string = swap.getInputWithoutFee().toString(); //Input amount excluding fees
const fee: string = swap.getFee().amountInSrcToken.toString(); //Fees paid on the output
const inputWithFees: string = swap.getInput().toString(); //Total amount paid including fees

const output: string = swap.getOutput().toString(); //Total output amount

//Get swap expiration time
const expiry: number = swap.getQuoteExpiry(); //Expiration time of the swap quote in UNIX milliseconds, swap needs to be initiated before this time

//Get security deposit amount (Human readable amount of STRK that needs to be put down to rent the liquidity from swap intermediary), you will get this deposit back if the swap succeeds
const securityDeposit: string = swap.getSecurityDeposit().toString();

//Get pricing info
const swapPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().swapPrice; //Price of the current swap (excluding fees)
const marketPrice = swap.getPriceInfo().marketPrice; //Current market price
const difference = swap.getPriceInfo().difference; //Difference between the swap price & current market price
```

Executing the swap (simple)

```typescript
await swap.execute(

### LNURLs & readable lightning identifiers

LNURLs extend the lightning network functionality by creating static lightning addreses (LNURL-pay & static internet identifiers) and QR codes which allow you to pull funds from them (LNURL-withdraw)

This SDK supports:
* LNURL-pay ([LUD-6](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md), [LUD-9](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/09.md), [LUD-10](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/10.md), [LUD-12](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/12.md))
* LNURL-withdraw ([LUD-3](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/03.md))
* Static internet identifiers ([LUD-16](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/16.md))

You can parse LNURLs and lightning invoices automatically using the [Unified address parser](#unified-address-parser)

#### Differences

Lightning invoices:
* One time use only
* Need to have a fixed amount, therefore recipient has to set the amount
* Static and bounded expiration
* You can only pay to a lightning invoice, not withdraw funds from it

LNURLs & lightning identifiers:
* Reusable
* Programmable expiry
* Allows payer to set an amount
* Supports both, paying (LNURL-pay) and withdrawing (LNURL-withdraw)
* Possibility to attach a message/comment to a payment
* Receive a message/url as a result of the payment

#### Swap Smart chain -> Bitcoin lightning network

- __1.__ Start listening to incoming lightning network payment (this also requests the payment from LNURL-withdraw service)
  ```typescript
  const success = await swap.waitForPayment();
  if(!success) {
      //Lightning network payment not received in time and quote expired
      return;
  }
  ```

- __2.__ Wait for the swap to be automatically settled
  ```typescript
  const automaticSettlementSuccess = await swap.waitTillClaimed(60);
  ```

- __3.__ In case the automatic swap settlement fails, we can settle it manually using the wallet of the destination chain

  - __a.__ Claim with signer
  ```typescript
  if(!automaticSettlementSuccess) {
      await swap.claim(starknetSigner);
  }
  ```

  - __b.__ Or get the transactions & [sign and send transaction manually](#manually-signing-smart-chain-transactions)
  ```typescript
  if(!automaticSettlementSuccess) {
      const txsClaim = await swap.txsClaim();
      //Sign and send these...
      ...
  }
  ```

### Getting state of the swap

You can get the current state of the swap with:

```typescript
const state = swap.getState();
```

You can also set a listener to listen for swap state changes:

```typescript
swap.events.on("swapState", swap => {
    const newState = swap.getState();
});
```

For the meaning of the states please refer to the "Swap state" section under each swap type.

### Swap size limits

Swap sizes are limited by the LPs you are connected to, they are advertised in BTC terms by LPs during handshake

```typescript
const swapLimits = swapper.getSwapLimits(srcToken, dstToken);
const inputMin = swapLimits.input.min;
const inputMax = swapLimits.input.max;
const outputMin = swapLimits.output.min;
const outputMax = swapLimits.output.max;
```

NOTE: swap limits denominated in BTC are retrieved from the LPs during initial handshake, however limits in other tokens are only returned when getting a quote fails due to amount being too low or too high. For example if you want to get swap limits for the BTC -> SOL swap, the input limits will be immediately available, while the output limits will only get populated once a quote request fails due to amount being too low or high.

```typescript
let swapLimits = swapper.getSwapLimits(Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, Tokens.SOLANA.SOL);
let inputMin = swapLimits.input.min; //Immediately available
let inputMax = swapLimits.input.max; //Immediately available
let outputMin = swapLimits.output.min; //Not available from the get-go
let outputMax = swapLimits.output.max; //Not available from the get-go

//You can also listen to swap limit changes (optional)
swapper.on("swapLimitsChanged", () => {
    //New limits available with swapper.getSwapLimits(srcToken, dstToken)
    //Useful in e.g. a react application where you want to dynamically set min/max swappable amount
})

//Try to swap really small amount of SOL with exactOut swap
try {
    const swap = await swapper.swap(
        Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, //Swap from BTC
        Tokens.SOLANA.SOL, //Into specified destination token
        1n, //1 lamport = 0.000000001 SOL
        false, //Whether we define an input or output amount
        undefined, //Source address for the swap, not used for swaps from BTC
        solanaSigner.getAddress() //Destination address
    );
} catch (e) {
    //Fails with OutOfBoundsError
}

swapLimits = swapper.getSwapLimits(Tokens.BITCOIN.BTC, Tokens.SOLANA.SOL);
inputMin = swapLimits.input.min; //Immediately available
inputMax = swapLimits.input.max; //Immediately available
outputMin = swapLimits.output.min; //Now available due to failed quote
outputMax = swapLimits.output.max; //Now available due to failed quote
```

### Stored swaps

#### Get swap by ID

You can retrieve a swap by it's id, you can get an ID of the swap with

```typescript
const swapId = swap.getId();
```

And then later retrieve it from the storage

```typescript
const swap = await swapper.getSwapById(id);
```

#### Get refundable swaps
You can refund the swaps in one of two cases:
* In case intermediary is non-cooperative and goes offline, you can claim the funds from the swap contract back after some time.
* In case intermediary tried to pay but was unsuccessful, so he sent you signed message with which you can refund now without waiting.

This call can be checked on every startup and periodically every few minutes.
```typescript
//Get refundable swaps and refund them
const refundableSolanaSwaps = await swapper.getRefundableSwaps("SOLANA", solanaSigner.getAddress());
for(let swap of refundableSolanaSwaps) await swap.refund(solanaSigner);
const refundableStarknetSwaps = await swapper.getRefundableSwaps("STARKNET", starknetSigner.getAddress());
for(let swap of refundableStarknetSwaps) await swap.refund(starknetSigner);
```

#### Get claimable swaps
Returns swaps that are ready to be claimed by the client, this can happen if client closes the application when a swap is in-progress and the swap is concluded while the client is offline.

```typescript
//Get the swaps
const claimableSolanaSwaps = await solanaSwapper.getClaimableSwaps("SOLANA", solanaSigner.getAddress());
//Claim all the claimable swaps
for(let swap of claimableSolanaSwaps) {
    await swap.claim(solanaSigner);
}
//Get the swaps
const claimableStarknetSwaps = await solanaSwapper.getClaimableSwaps("STARKNET", starknetSigner.getAddress());
//Claim all the claimable swaps
for(let swap of claimableStarknetSwaps) {
  await swap.claim(starknetSigner);
}
```

### Helpers

#### Getting wallet balances

The SDK also contains helper functions for getting the maximum spendable balance of wallets

```typescript
//Spendable balance of the starknet wallet address (discounting transaction fees)
const strkBalance = await swapper.Utils.getSpendableBalance(starknetSigner, Tokens.STARKNET.STRK);
//Spendable balance of the solana wallet address (discounting transaction fees)
const solBalance = await swapper.Utils.getSpendableBalance(solanaSigner, Tokens.SOLANA.SOL);
//Spendable balance of the bitcoin wallet - here we also need to specify the destination chain (as there are different swap protocols available with different on-chain footprints)
const {balance: btcBalance, feeRate: btcFeeRate} = await swapper.Utils.getBitcoinSpendableBalance(bitcoinWalletAddress, "SOLANA");
```

#### Unified address parser

A common way for parsing all address formats supported by the SDK, automatically recognizes:
- Bitcoin on-chain L1 address formats (p2pkh, p2wpkh, p2wsh, p2wsh, p2tr)
- [BIP-21](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021) bitcoin payment URI
- BOLT11 lightning network invoices
- [LUD-6](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md) LNURL-pay links
- [LUD-3](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/03.md) LNURL-withdraw links
- [LUD-16](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/16.md) Lightning static internet identifiers 
- Smart chain addresses (Solana, Starknet, etc.)

```typescript
const res = await swapper.Utils.parseAddress(address);
switch(res.type) {
  case "BITCOIN":
    //Bitcoin on-chain L1 address or BIP-21 URI scheme with amount
    const btcAmount = res.amount;
    break;
  case "LIGHTNING":
    //BOLT11 lightning network invoice with pre-set amount
    const lnAmount = res.amount;
    break;
  case "LNURL":
    //LNURL payment or withdrawal link
    if(isLNURLWithdraw(res.lnurl)) {
      //LNURL-withdraw allowing withdrawals over the lightning network
      const lnurlWithdrawData: LNURLWithdraw = res.lnurl;
      const minWithdrawable = res.min; //Minimum payment amount
      const maxWithdrawable = res.max; //Maximum payment amount
      const fixedAmount = res.amount; //If res.min===res.max, an fixed amount is returned instead
      //Should show a UI allowing the user to choose an amount he wishes to withdraw
    }
    if(isLNURLPay(res.lnurl)) {
      //LNURL-pay or static lightning internet identifier allowing repeated payments over the lightning network
      const lnurlPayData: LNURLPay = res.lnurl;
      const minPayable = res.min; //Minimum payment amount
      const maxPayable = res.max; //Maximum payment amount
      const fixedAmount = res.amount; //If res.min===res.max, an fixed amount is returned instead
      const icon: (string | null) = res.lnurl.icon; //URL encoded icon that should be displayed on the UI
      const shortDescription: (string | null) = res.lnurl.shortDescription; //Short description of the payment
      const longDescription: (string | null) = res.lnurl.longDescription; //Long description of the payment
      const maxCommentLength: (number | 0) = res.lnurl.commentMaxLength; //Maximum allowed length of the payment message/comment (0 means no comment allowed)
      //Should show a UI displaying the icon, short description, long description, allowing the user to choose an amount he wishes to pay and possibly also a comment
    }
    break;
  default:
    //Addresses for smart chains
    break;
}
```

### Manually signing smart chain transactions

You can also sign the transactions on smart chain side (Solana, Starknet, etc.) of the SDK externally by a separate wallet. Each function which executes any transaction has its txs(action) counterpart, e.g.:
- commit() -> txsCommit()
- claim() -> txsClaim()
- commitAndClaim -> txsCommitAndClaim()
- refund() -> txsRefund()

After sending the transactions, you also need to make sure the SDK has enough time to receive an event notification of the transaction being executed, for this you have the waitTill(action) functions, e.g.:

- commit() -> waitTillCommited()
- claim() -> waitTillClaimed()
- commitAndClaim -> waitTillClaimed()
- refund() -> waitTillRefunded()

```typescript
//Example for Solana
const txns = await swap.txsCommit(); //Also works with txsClaim, txsRefund, txCommitAndClaim
txns.forEach(val => if(val.signers.length>0) { val.tx.sign(...val.signers) });
const signedTransactions = await solanaSigner.wallet.signAllTransactions(txns.map(val => val.tx));
for(let tx of signedTransactions) {
    const res = await solanaRpc.sendRawTransaction(tx.serialize());
    await solanaRpc.confirmTransaction(res);
}
await swap.waitTillCommited(); //Or other relevant waitTillClaimed, waitTillRefunded

//Example for Starknet
const txns = await swap.txsCommit(); //Also works with txsClaim, txsRefund, txCommitAndClaim
for(let tx of txns) {
    if(tx.type==="INVOKE") await starknetSigner.account.execute(tx.tx, tx.details);
    if(tx.type==="DEPLOY_ACCOUNT") await starknetSigner.account.deployAccount(tx.tx, tx.details);
}
await swap.waitTillCommited(); //Or other relevant waitTillClaimed, waitTillRefunded

//Example for EVM
const txns = await swap.txsCommit(); //Also works with txsClaim, txsRefund, txCommitAndClaim
for(let tx of txns) {
  await evmSigner.account.sendTransaction(tx);
}
await swap.waitTillCommited(); //Or other relevant waitTillClaimed, waitTillRefunded
```

### Additional swapper options

You can further customize the swapper instance with these options, you can:
- adjust the maximum accepted pricing difference from the LPs
- use custom mempool.space instance
- use custom pricing API
- use own LP node for swaps
- adjust HTTP request timeouts
- add parameters to be sent with each LP request

```typescript
const swapper = Factory.newSwapper({
    ...
    //Additional optional options
    pricingFeeDifferencePPM: 20000n, //Maximum allowed pricing difference for quote (between swap & market price) in ppm (parts per million) (20000 == 2%)
    mempoolApi: new MempoolApi("<url to custom mempool.space instance>"), //Set the SDK to use a custom mempool.space instance instead of the public one
    getPriceFn: (tickers: string[], abortSignal?: AbortSignal) => customPricingApi.getUsdPriceForTickers(tickers) //Overrides the default pricing API engine with a custom price getter

    intermediaryUrl: "<url to custom LP node>",
    registryUrl: "<url to custom LP node registry>",

    getRequestTimeout: 10000, //Timeout in milliseconds for GET requests
    postRequestTimeout: 10000, //Timeout in milliseconds for POST requests
    defaultAdditionalParameters: {lpData: "Pls give gud price"}, //Additional request data sent to LPs

    defaultTrustedIntermediaryUrl: "<url to custom LP node>" //LP node/intermediary to use for trusted gas swaps
});
```
